Hi there! This is a little puzzle for you!

- Extract the summary of each git commit
- Remove the last line
- Reverse the file (line by line, last line first)
- Decode the base64 string
- Unpack the message (gzip compression)
- Sort the output numerically based on the 2nd key
- Remove lines containing "eetacol"
- Remove the first 5 lines
- Remove the first two fields (tab-separated)

Feel free to send an email to jobs@locatee.ch if you have any questions!
